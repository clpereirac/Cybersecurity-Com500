# Assignment 1: Security Risk Assessment

## Overview
Conduct a comprehensive security risk assessment for a fictional small business. This assignment will help you apply fundamental cybersecurity concepts and risk management principles learned in Module 1.

## Scenario
**Company**: TechStart Solutions  
**Business**: Small software development company (25 employees)  
**Services**: Custom web application development, mobile app development  
**Infrastructure**: On-premises servers, cloud services (AWS), employee workstations  

## Assignment Objectives
1. Demonstrate understanding of risk assessment methodology
2. Apply the CIA triad to real-world scenarios
3. Identify and analyze security threats and vulnerabilities
4. Propose practical security controls and recommendations

## Deliverables

### Part 1: Asset Inventory (20 points)
Create a comprehensive inventory of TechStart Solutions' assets including:

#### Information Assets
- Customer data and project files
- Source code repositories
- Financial records
- Employee personal information
- Intellectual property

#### Technology Assets
- Servers and networking equipment
- Employee workstations and mobile devices
- Software applications and licenses
- Cloud service accounts

#### Physical Assets
- Office facilities and equipment
- Paper documents and storage media

**Format**: Create a table with columns for Asset Name, Type, Owner, Criticality Level (1-5), and Description.

### Part 2: Threat Identification (20 points)
Identify potential threats to TechStart Solutions:

#### External Threats
- Cybercriminals and hackers
- Competitors seeking intellectual property
- Malicious software and phishing attacks
- Natural disasters

#### Internal Threats
- Disgruntled employees
- Accidental data loss or system damage
- Inadequate security practices

**Format**: For each threat, provide:
- Threat description
- Potential impact on the business
- Likelihood assessment (Low/Medium/High)

### Part 3: Vulnerability Assessment (25 points)
Analyze vulnerabilities in TechStart's current environment:

#### Technical Vulnerabilities
- Unpatched software systems
- Weak authentication mechanisms
- Inadequate network security
- Insufficient data backup procedures

#### Process Vulnerabilities
- Lack of security policies
- Inadequate employee training
- Poor incident response procedures
- Insufficient access controls

#### Physical Vulnerabilities
- Unsecured facilities
- Unprotected equipment
- Poor document handling

**Format**: Create a vulnerability matrix showing:
- Vulnerability description
- Asset(s) affected
- Potential exploitation methods
- Severity level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

### Part 4: Risk Analysis (25 points)
Calculate and prioritize risks using the formula: **Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact**

#### Risk Assessment Matrix
Create a risk register with the following information:
- Risk ID and description
- Threat source
- Vulnerability exploited
- Potential impact (financial, operational, reputational)
- Likelihood score (1-5)
- Impact score (1-5)
- Overall risk score (1-25)
- Risk level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

#### Top 5 Critical Risks
Identify and elaborate on the five highest-priority risks, including:
- Detailed risk scenario
- Potential business consequences
- Estimated financial impact (if applicable)

### Part 5: Risk Treatment Recommendations (10 points)
For each of the top 5 risks, propose appropriate treatment strategies:

#### Risk Treatment Options
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor the risk
- **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk source
- **Mitigate**: Implement controls to reduce likelihood or impact
- **Transfer**: Share the risk through insurance or outsourcing

#### Security Controls
Recommend specific security controls such as:
- Technical controls (firewalls, encryption, antivirus)
- Administrative controls (policies, training, procedures)
- Physical controls (locks, surveillance, environmental protection)
