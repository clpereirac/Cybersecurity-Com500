# Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
1. Define cybersecurity and explain its importance in modern organizations
2. Identify the core principles of information security (CIA Triad)
3. Understand the current threat landscape and common attack vectors
4. Explain fundamental risk management concepts
5. Describe the cybersecurity professional's role and responsibilities

## Module Overview

### 1.1 What is Cybersecurity?

**Definition**: Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

**Key Areas**:
- Network Security
- Application Security
- Information Security
- Operational Security
- Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
- End-user Education

### 1.2 The CIA Triad

The foundation of information security rests on three core principles:

#### Confidentiality
- Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals
- Protection against unauthorized disclosure
- Methods: encryption, access controls, authentication

#### Integrity
- Maintaining accuracy and completeness of data
- Protection against unauthorized modification
- Methods: digital signatures, checksums, version control

#### Availability
- Ensuring information and resources are accessible when needed
- Protection against disruption of service
- Methods: redundancy, backups, fault tolerance

### 1.3 Current Threat Landscape

#### Common Threat Actors:
1. **Cybercriminals**: Motivated by financial gain
2. **Nation-States**: Espionage and political objectives
3. **Hacktivists**: Ideological motivations
4. **Insider Threats**: Malicious or negligent employees
5. **Script Kiddies**: Amateur attackers using existing tools

#### Common Attack Vectors:
- **Malware**: Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware
- **Phishing**: Social engineering via email/web
- **SQL Injection**: Database attacks through web applications
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: Intercepting communications
- **DDoS**: Overwhelming systems with traffic
- **Zero-day Exploits**: Unknown vulnerabilities

### 1.4 Risk Management Fundamentals

#### Risk Assessment Process:
1. **Asset Identification**: What needs protection?
2. **Threat Identification**: What could go wrong?
3. **Vulnerability Assessment**: What weaknesses exist?
4. **Risk Analysis**: What is the likelihood and impact?
5. **Risk Treatment**: How to address the risks?

#### Risk Treatment Options:
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor
- **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk source
- **Mitigate**: Reduce likelihood or impact
- **Transfer**: Share risk (insurance, outsourcing)

### 1.5 Cybersecurity Frameworks

#### NIST Cybersecurity Framework
Five core functions:
1. **Identify**: Asset management, governance
2. **Protect**: Access control, training
3. **Detect**: Monitoring, detection processes
4. **Respond**: Response planning, communications
5. **Recover**: Recovery planning, improvements

#### ISO 27001
International standard for information security management systems (ISMS)

### 1.6 Legal and Ethical Considerations

#### Key Regulations:
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation (EU)
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (US)
- **SOX**: Sarbanes-Oxley Act (US)
- **PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

#### Ethical Principles:
- Respect for privacy and confidentiality
- Professional integrity and honesty
- Responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities
- Compliance with laws and regulations

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Risk Assessment Scenario
Conduct a basic risk assessment for a small e-commerce website:
1. Identify key assets
2. List potential threats
3. Assess vulnerabilities
4. Calculate risk levels
5. Propose mitigation strategies

### Exercise 2: Current Events Analysis
Research a recent cybersecurity incident:
1. Describe the attack
2. Identify the threat actor type
3. Analyze the impact
4. Discuss prevention measures

## Self-Assessment Quiz
